# Investigation of the Impact of Economic and Social Factors on Energy Demand through Natural Language Processing

![Intro](example.png)

## Abstract

The relationship between energy demand and economic activity or weather is a well-established fact. However, this paper presents a study that aims to explore the connection between energy demand and other social aspects of society, which receives little attention. Through the use of natural language processing on a large news corpus, we can shed light on this important link. The study is carried out in five regions of the UK and Ireland and considers multiple horizons from 1 to 30 days. It also takes into account the impact of economic variables such as GDP growth, unemployment and inflation. We found that: 1) News about military conflicts, transport, the global pandemic, regional development and the international energy market are related to electricity demand. 2) Economic indices are more important for predicting demand in some regions, such as East Midlands and Northern Ireland, while social indices are more useful for West Midlands and South West. 3) The use of these indices improved forecasting performance by between 5% and 10% in several regions.
